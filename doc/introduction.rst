Introduction
============

Fennec is an acronym for "Functional Exploration of Natural Networks and Ecological Communities".
It is a web platform that facilitates enrichment of (taxonomically classified) community tables with trait data.
For this purpose trait information from various sources is stored in a database.
Users can then upload their community tables, map the organisms to entries in the database and automatically retrieve all relevant traits.
Fennec provides basic visualization of trait composition in the community by integrating Phinch.
Enriched community tables can be exported for use in external analysis tools like PhyloSeq.
